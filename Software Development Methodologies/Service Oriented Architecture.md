# Service-oriented architecture

	A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. The basic principles of service oriented architecture are independent of vendors, products and technologies.[1] A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online.

	A service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:

1. It logically represents a business activity with a specified outcome.
2. It is self-contained.
3. It is a black box for its consumers
4. It may consist of other underlying services.

	Different services can be used in conjunction to provide the functionality of a large software application.[4] Service-oriented architecture makes it easier for software components to communicate and cooperate over the network, without requiring any human interaction or changes in the underlying program, so that service candidates can be redesigned before their implementation.
